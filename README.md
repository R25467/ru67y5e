    <h3 id="Intro">Introduction</h3>

    <p>Mars is well-known as the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet.</p>

    <h3 id="Red-Mars">The <b class="red">Red</b> Planet</h3>

    <p>Many people give Mars many different nicknames, but the <b>most </b>commmon one is "The <em class="red">Red</em> Planet." Scientists say that, and in order to know <em>how</em> they gave the nickname we need to see this image:</p>
    <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg">See Mars Image Here</a>
    <p>See the <em class="red">redness</em> on the Mars surface? This is how scientists named it the <em class="red">red</em> planet</p>
    <h3 id="name-Mars">The "name" of Mars</h3>
    <p>You might be asking "How did Mars form it's name?" and this is the answer:<br>
        Well, a long time ago (not when the dinosaurs roamed the Earth) but when Roman would think in myths. And since Mars is visual with a naked eye. There was a myth about Mars too.<br>
        There were a lot of war back then and Mars (actually Martian) got its name after the <em>Roman God of War.</em></p>
        <h3>Mount Everest vs. Mount Olympus!</h3>
    <p>Maybe you have heard about Mount Everst (The tallest mountain in the world). But you wanna know what's bigger? It is (drumroll please) Mount Olympus. the height is 3 Mount Everests staked on top of each other!<br>
        No one has ever climbed it because no one has been on Mars, but you may be asking that a rover could have been climbling Olympus, but no. Because:
        <ul><li><p>Scientists never made such a huge power supply (or should I say power BANK).</p></li><li><p>Even if they launched a new rover. It would get stuck mid way because of power.</p></li><li><p>If we cling on onto 2 bullet point. Another rover could come. But it would fail either not caught with the rover/caught up with the rover and dead/little more distance than the rover and dead.</p></li></ul>
